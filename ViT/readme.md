# ViT Models

This directory contains the three ViT model versions developed and evaluated as part of the master thesis.  
Each folder corresponds to a specific ViT variant and includes:

- The two best model checkpoints (`.pt`)
- The evaluation output on the Evaldataset as CSV file with predicted and true labels
- The evaluation metrics of the two best models in plain text (`.txt`), including F1-score, Hamming Loss, and confusion matrix
- The training code used for training
